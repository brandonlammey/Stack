# Stack

This generic templated stack data structure will create a stack object with a pointer and a size. The Pointer will point to dynamically allocated nodes and be able to perform basic stack operations: 

* Push
* Pop
* Peek
* Check size
* Check if empty

## Purpose

To provide a templated stack data structure to be used in any C++ program.  

## Configure

Remove Makefile and main.cpp
Add to personal code and Makefile 
Include with `#include "Stack.h"`


## Tests

#### **Currently in progress of adding test cases!**
